### Feedback 

**Please add any feedback you have on our take home exercise here**

I thoroughly enjoyed completing this take-home exercise. It presented a welcome challenge, prompting me to re-engage with Java after a significant hiatus. Additionally, this project provided an excellent opportunity to learn new concepts, such as `Accept-Header` usage, and explore valuable tools like `NetLimiter`.

Beyond the immediate goal of a job opportunity, I approached this exercise as a valuable learning experience. It has resulted in a solid Java project for my GitHub portfolio, which I intend to further develop into a server-based solution when time permits. Therefore, this project will remain a continued area of focus for me even after submission.
